research Questions:

In this analysis we try to find if is there a relation between age, sex, income level and depression level,
how does it changed from 2014 to 2019, and what is the geopraphical span and severity of this depression among countries. 
there is a hypothesis that as income decreases, depression level will increase.

In addition (using second dataset) we search to find if is there a relation between age, sex, education level and depression level, 
how does it changed from 2014 to 2019 and look at its geopraphical span and severity. 
the hypothesis here is that as we see an increase in education level, depression values will decrease.

After doing these preparatory analysis on the tow datasets we reach to the research question 
which is checking for a given depression level how income and education change? in other word 
we try to see if is there a relation between income and education (direct or indirect relation) for a specific value of depression?
to do this we categorized values of depression rates and for each year, 2014 and 2019, extractd a dataframe including 
depression and income levels in a row to check possible relations. the results are shown.
